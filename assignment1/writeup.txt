This assignment involves building recommendation models to predict user interactions with books on Goodreads. 
I used collaborative filtering models for rating prediction and classification models for read prediction, aiming to exceed baseline performance.

Read Prediction:
	1.	Baseline:
	•	A popularity-based baseline was used, predicting “1” for popular books and “0” otherwise.
	2.	Model:
	•	A Random Forest model was implemented with features like book_popularity and user_read_count.
	•	Grid search was used to tune parameters, with the best settings achieving an accuracy of 50.5%.
	3.	Results:
	•	The Random Forest model’s accuracy was 50.5%, slightly above the baseline, indicating limited predictive power on this dataset.

Rating Prediction:
	1.	Baseline:
	•	A baseline model using global and user-specific average ratings was implemented.
	2.	Model (SVD):
	•	An SVD model with grid search for parameter tuning was used, achieving an RMSE of 1.2099 with the best parameters.
	3.	Model (NCF):
	•	An NCF model was trained for 10 epochs, with the loss reducing from 3.7219 to 1.7784. Although NCF showed steady learning, the tuned SVD model achieved better validation RMSE.
	4.	Results:
	•	The SVD model’s RMSE of 1.2099 outperformed the baseline and served as the primary model for rating prediction.

The SVD model performed well on the rating prediction task, with reasonable RMSE for a collaborative filtering approach. 
The Random Forest model showed moderate success in read prediction but had limited accuracy, possibly due to data sparsity. 
Future work could involve adding more features to the read prediction model to enhance its accuracy.
